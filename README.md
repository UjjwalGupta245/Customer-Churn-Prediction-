# Customer_Prediction_Using_ANN

Welcome to the **Customer Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** repository! This project is part of my Data Analyst portfolio, and showcasing my ability to analyze data, build predictive models, and communicate actionable insights.

## **About the Project**

This project leverages a machine learning approach to predict whether a customer will leave a service (churn) or stay. By analyzing historical data, the model helps businesses understand customer patterns and take proactive actions to retain them.

## **What I Learned**

Through this project, I acquired and applied the following data analysis skills:

1. **Machine Learning Basics**  
   - Understanding how models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) work to predict outcomes.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removing missing or inconsistent data to ensure high-quality input for the model.

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Creating visual representations of data to uncover trends and patterns.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Converting categorical data into numeric forms using `pandas.get_dummies` for better model interpretation.  
   - Changing data types (int, float) for compatibility with the model.

5. **Scaling the Data**  
   - Normalizing data values to improve model performance.

6. **Train-Test Splitting**  
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model accuracy effectively.

7. **Finding Number of Churns**  
   - Identifying and analyzing the count of customers who have churned.

## **How It Works**

Imagine you own a business and want to know which customers might stop using your service. This project uses data and a "smart brain" (Artificial Neural Network) to:
1. Study patterns in customer data (like purchases or visits).  
2. Learn from past trends to predict future behaviour.  
3. Help you take action to retain customers and improve their experience.
